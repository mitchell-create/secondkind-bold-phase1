# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.) working
in this repo. Read this before making changes.

## What this project is

AdCreatives is an AI-powered ad creative pipeline for an ad agency running multiple
client accounts. Two-phase model:

- **Phase 1 — Strategy.** Brand research → personas → products → offers → strategy
  matrix → psychology profiles → creative briefs. Eleven steps, not just one CLI call.
  Outputs live in `clients/<slug>/`.
- **Phase 2 — Image generation.** Briefs → fal.ai prompts → rendered PNGs. Outputs
  live in `ai-ads/<slug>/` (gitignored, regenerable).

Read `docs/pipeline-rules.md` before touching the pipeline. It encodes hard-won
operating rules (one product per run for multi-SKU brands, persona awareness
calibration, gap-map filters, no-competitor-naming) — do not relax them without
explicit user discussion.

Read `docs/creative-production-system.md` before doing hands-on ad production,
reference recreation, Higgsfield generation, local text overlays, or Canva
handoff work. It captures current tool roles, native text presets, product
handling, reference packets, crop-safety, and pre-send QA rules.

Read `docs/static-ad-production-test-plan.md` before running controlled static
production tests such as one-pass vs two-pass Higgsfield, JSON vs natural
language prompts, model bake-offs, Pinterest/Soul model sourcing, product
locking, or local vs Canva text-overlay comparisons.

Read `docs/audience-conversion-report.md` before new-client research, ICP
refreshes, VOC collection, GigaBrain/Reddit/TikTok review mining, or turning
raw audience data into ad angles. It defines the automation-first raw-data
dump, OpenClaw/browser-assisted source collection, Audience Conversion Report,
source-truth check, behavior/moment extraction, exact customer terminology,
and product-USP angle mapping workflow.

Read `docs/phase-2-static-briefing-workflow.md` before turning Phase 1 research
into static ad concepts. It defines the required Phase 2 gates: research
synthesis, avatar selection, mass-desire selection, direct + adjacent ad
analysis, 70/20/10 source mix, angle bank by awareness level, operator-chosen
visual format, template-specific copy, and approval before production.

Read `docs/canva-connect-oauth.md` before adding or troubleshooting Canva
Connect API access. Canva uses OAuth with PKCE, not a generic API key.

## Agent write policy (ALL agents, all machines — including orchestrator/main agents)

- Tracked pipeline code and docs change ONLY via an attributable feature/fork
  branch + PR — never as direct edits sitting uncommitted on master. This binds
  every agent on every box, including main/orchestrator agents patching "just a
  small fallback" mid-task. (2026-07-06: an orchestrator agent patched
  `strategy/catalog.py` mid-thread with an untested curl fallback; it sat as
  unattributed drift for a day and was discarded.)
- `clients/<slug>/` is working data — agents write there freely for the client
  they are working on.
- `references/swipe/analyzed/` (the Ad Reference Library) is written ONLY via
  `adc library save` / `adc library update` — every card is human-approved in
  Slack and carries provenance, so it is working data: the workflow commits
  card files directly to master (scoped to that folder, plain commits, never
  amend/force-push). Never hand-author or hand-edit card YAML there. See
  `docs/ad-analyzer-openclaw.md`.
- Never write agent-local artifacts (`.learnings/`, scratch logs, skill
  proposals) inside this repo; keep them in the agent's own workspace.
- Found the working tree dirty with changes you didn't make? Post the full diff
  to #creative-strategist immediately and leave it untouched (no commit, stash,
  or discard) until reviewed.
- Never hand-write artifacts that mimic pipeline output (gap maps, personas,
  psychology profiles, catalog censuses) and let them pass as command output.
  If a stage fails, report the failure and fix the stage. If a manual artifact
  is genuinely needed, it must say so inside the file (`provenance: manual`) —
  pipeline stages exist so results are reproducible, costed, and auditable
  (the cost log is the proof of what actually ran).

## Quickstart

- Python **3.11+**.
- `pip install -e .` from the repo root (or `pip install -e ".[dev]"` for tests).
- `.env` at repo root supplies API keys (fal, OpenAI, Anthropic, Exa, Apify, Google,
  `HF_CREDENTIALS`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`/`REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` for the Reddit VOC
  layer — Exa cannot serve reddit.com anymore). Not committed. The CLI auto-loads
  it via `_bootstrap_env_from_dotenv`.
- CLI entry: `adc --help` (defined in `cli.py`).
- Dashboard: `adc dashboard` (Streamlit, reads local files only, no API calls).
- Firecrawl is the default managed crawler/page-fetcher for AdCreatives research.
  Do not block client research on a Brave Search API key. If a Slack/OpenClaw
  workflow asks for Brave, that is outside the repo pipeline; route page crawling
  through Firecrawl and broad discovery through Exa/Apify/Reddit as configured.

## Canva Connect integration

Canva Connect API access is OAuth-based. Configure `CANVA_CLIENT_ID`,
`CANVA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CANVA_REDIRECT_URI`, and `CANVA_SCOPES` in local `.env`,
then use `adc canva auth-url` and `adc canva callback-server` to test the OAuth
flow and save local access/refresh tokens. See `docs/canva-connect-oauth.md`.

## Higgsfield integration

Higgsfield AI is wired into both the brief→image pipeline (`--engine
higgsfield-soul`) and the agent's own toolset. Three layers:

1. **Runtime REST client** at `generators/higgsfield_client.py` — used by
   `adc remix-images`, `adc remix-refine`, and `adc generate` when
   `--engine higgsfield-soul` is set. Auth via `HF_CREDENTIALS` in `.env`.
   This is the path the dashboard buttons call. Do NOT refactor it to shell
   out to the CLI — direct HTTP is faster and has retry control.
2. **Higgsfield CLI** at `higgsfield` (and `hf`) on PATH — for agent
   management tasks: list trained Souls, check credits, train new Souls,
   one-off generations. Install: `npm install -g @higgsfield/cli` (or the
   release binary if npm postinstall fails on Windows). Auth:
   `higgsfield auth login` (browser device flow).
3. **Skill pack** under `.agents/skills/` (gitignored, per-machine) — four
   slash commands installed via `npx skills add higgsfield-ai/skills`:
   `/higgsfield-generate`, `/higgsfield-soul-id`,
   `/higgsfield-product-photoshoot`, `/higgsfield-marketplace-cards`. They
   wrap the CLI with structured prompts. Prefer these over the deprecated
   Higgsfield MCP connector.

The previous Higgsfield Claude.ai MCP connector (`mcp.higgsfield.ai/mcp`)
is being phased out in favor of the CLI + skills. Per-persona Soul
Characters are tracked under each avatar YAML's `higgsfield:` block
(`soul_id`, `soul_status`).

**TODO (deferred 2026-05-16):** Remove the Higgsfield MCP connector from
Claude.ai. It must be removed via the web UI at
https://claude.ai/settings/connectors — `claude mcp remove` does not work
on Claude.ai-managed connectors (it can list them but not delete them).
Until removed, the MCP tools coexist with the CLI/skills; nothing breaks,
but the toolset is noisier than it needs to be. After removal, restart
Claude Code to drop the `mcp__dc37e644-...__*` tools from the available
set.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cli.py` | All `adc` commands (Click). One file by design. |
| `strategy/` | Phase 1 logic: research, personas, matrix, status, costs |
| `generators/` | Prompt composers, fal.ai client, reference analyzer |
| `validators/` | Brand compliance, platform specs, copy limits |
| `models/` | Pydantic schemas |
| `dashboard/app.py` | Streamlit web dashboard |
| `clients/<slug>/` | Per-client strategy data (YAML + MD). Mostly gitignored — only the listed test clients in `.gitignore` are committed. |
| `ai-ads/<slug>/` | Generated PNGs + prompt txts. Gitignored, regenerable. |
| `prompts/skills/` | LLM system-prompt skills, loaded at runtime |
| `references/` | Reference ad images, curated by archetype |
| `docs/` | Operating rules and design docs — read these |
| `scripts/` | One-off maintenance scripts (backfills, uploads) |
| `tests/` | pytest suite |

## Conventions

- **Immutability.** Return new objects; do not mutate inputs.
- **File size.** 200–400 lines typical, hard cap 800. `cli.py` is the exception.
- **Function size.** Aim under 50 lines.
- **Paths.** Use `pathlib.Path` everywhere. The repo runs on Windows and Unix.
- **Types.** Type hints on public functions. Pydantic for structured payloads.
- **Errors.** Handle at the boundary, fail fast with a clear message. Don't swallow.
- **Secrets.** Never hardcode. `.env` is the only source. Never commit it.
- **Comments.** Default to none. Add one only when the *why* is non-obvious.
- **Backwards-compat shims.** Don't add them for code that isn't shipped.
- **Em-dashes are banned in ad copy output.** They are fine in repo docs and comments.

## Cost awareness

This project spends real money on every `adc generate`, `adc research`, `adc prompts`,
`adc mine-voc`, `adc research-amazon`, and `adc research-competitors` run.

- **Never run image generation, Amazon scraping, or large research jobs without
  confirming with the user first.** Quote the expected cost from the cost log if
  available (`clients/<slug>/.cost-log.jsonl`) or estimate before asking.
- Local-only commands (`adc status`, `adc dashboard`, `adc list-clients`,
  `adc list-templates`, `adc menu`, `adc show-prompt`) are free — run freely.

## Native ad design rules (when working on visual templates or ad copy)

These are hard rules. If you're editing templates, brief outputs, or prompt copy:

- No em-dashes in ad copy.
- Sourcing rule applies (cite review sources when claims appear in copy).
- No UI chrome in image ads (no fake browser bars, fake DM overlays unless the
  template is explicitly that format).
- Pill sizing matches the visual format spec.
- Wild brand aesthetic where applicable.

Full design philosophy and template work belongs in the relevant style files under
`styles/` and `prompts/skills/`. Do not invent new rules — confirm with the user.

## Common commands

Phase 1 (strategy). `adc onboard` covers ONLY the first five stages — never
report "full process complete" after it:
```
adc onboard --client <slug> --url <homepage>
#   = research → product-deep-dive → personas → offers → strategy-matrix
#     (stages 1-5; each also runnable individually)

adc profile-psychology --client <slug>
adc scaffold-competitors --client <slug> --names "A, B, C"
#   creates competitors.yaml with *_search_queries pre-filled (search queries
#   beat brand handles ~17x on comment yield). If the file exists, it enriches
#   in place: adds ONLY missing search queries, never touches hand-written
#   fields. Then fill url/notes per competitor.
adc suggest-amazon --client <slug>
#   Exa-suggested Amazon listing candidates per competitor — human confirms
#   and adds to amazon_urls (never auto-added; reseller lookalikes poison
#   review mining)
adc research-competitors --client <slug>     # Exa sentiment + on-site reviews
adc research-amazon --client <slug>          # needs amazon_urls
adc research-social --client <slug>          # TikTok / Instagram / YouTube comments
#   both research commands print a source-quality preflight BEFORE spending;
#   heed a LOW verdict — fix competitors.yaml instead of running anyway
adc audience-conversion collect --client <slug> --product <product-id> --category <category>
#   free/local: consolidates existing brand, product, VOC, review, social, and
#   Exa artifacts into clients/<slug>/research/audience-conversion/ for
#   source-truthed synthesis; use --manual-source for extra raw TXT/MD notes
adc audience-conversion phase2-static --client <slug> --product <product-id>
#   free/local: creates the Phase 2 static briefing workbook with gates for
#   avatar, mass desire, competitor/adjacent ad analysis, angle bank, template
#   selection, template-specific copy, and approval before production
adc mine-voc --client <slug> --category <c>
adc analyze-gaps --client <slug>
adc brief --client <slug> --product <id> --angles 6
```

Verify completeness with `adc status --client <slug>` before calling Phase 1
done — it now checks expected-vs-actual Exa query counts, review COUNTS (not
just file existence), social comment counts, and briefs/prompts/images.

Research diagnostics — check these whenever a layer reports 0 items:
```
clients/<slug>/research/exa/errors/              # failed Exa queries, persisted per label
clients/<slug>/research/<platform>-diagnostics/  # social pulls that returned 0 comments
clients/<slug>/research/competitor-reviews/*.json  # `notes` explains vendor detection
```
Source-mismatch rules (Amazon / Trustpilot / YouTube expectations) live in
`docs/pipeline-rules.md` rule 6.

Phase 2 (image gen):
```
adc menu --client <slug>
adc prompts --client <slug> --pick 1,2,3
adc generate --client <slug> --pick 1,2,3
```

Status / browsing (free, local):
```
adc status --client <slug>
adc dashboard
adc list-clients
adc list-templates --client <slug>
```

## Git

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `perf:`, `ci:`.
- No co-author / attribution footer.
- Never commit `.env`, `ai-ads/`, `__pycache__/`, `clients/<new-slug>/` for non-test
  clients, or any `*.png` outside `references/`.
- Before committing: check `git status` for accidentally-tracked binaries.

## Testing

- `pytest` from the repo root. Target 80%+ coverage on new code.
- Tests live under `tests/`. Mirror module layout when adding new ones.
- TDD for new behavior: failing test first, then minimal implementation.

## Things to never do

- Run paid commands (`generate`, `research-*`, `mine-voc`) without user confirmation.
- Commit secrets, generated images, or per-client working dirs that aren't in the
  whitelist.
- Use destructive git operations (`reset --hard`, force push, branch delete) without
  asking.
- Relax pipeline rules (`docs/pipeline-rules.md`) silently — surface the trade-off.
- Add features beyond what was asked. Bug fixes don't need cleanup; one-shot tasks
  don't need helpers.

## When the user pastes an API key in chat

Remind them to rotate it after the session. Do not store it in code, comments, or
commit history.
