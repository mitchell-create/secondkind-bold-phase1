"""AI first-pass analysis of a competitor ad → draft reference card.

The expert-eye layer of the Ad Reference Library: a vision model breaks an
ad down into the agency's creative vocabulary (format, hook tactic,
mechanic, scan path, proof, awareness stage) plus honest steal/avoid lines.
The output is a DRAFT — a human reviewer approves, corrects, or escalates
before anything reaches the library (see strategy/ad_card.py).

The system prompt is GENERATED from the taxonomy skill docs on every call
(strategy/taxonomy.py), so the analyzer's vocabulary can never drift from
the strategist's. The taxonomy content hash is stamped into every draft.

Intake accepts either a local image file or a Foreplay ad id — the Foreplay
path pulls brand, headline, and exact runtime from the API so the operator
never retypes (or mistypes) the proxy signal.
