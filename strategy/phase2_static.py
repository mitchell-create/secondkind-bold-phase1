This workbook is the required bridge between the Audience Conversion Report and
static ad production. Do not jump directly into visual formats or image
generation. Complete the gates in order.

## Operating Sequence

1. Synthesize audience research.
2. Pick one avatar.
3. Pick one mass desire, core objection, misconception, failed solution, or
   behavior/moment.
4. Pull and analyze competitor plus adjacent-niche ads.
5. Build the 70/20/10 concept source mix.
6. Build the angle bank by awareness level.
7. Ask the operator to choose the visual format/template.
8. Write template-specific benefits, negatives, and headlines.
9. Run the Static Mistake Filter.
10. Get approval before production or paid generation.

## Gate 1: Audience Research Synthesis

Use the Audience Conversion Report and source-truth check. Fill this before
concepting.

### Psychographics

| Insight | Source language | Why it matters for ads |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

### Problems And Desires

| Problem/desire | Exact language | Source | Ad implication |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

### Behaviors And Moments

| Moment | Trigger | Behavior | Exact language | Ad angle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### Objections And Misconceptions

| Objection/misconception | Customer wording | Source | How the ad should handle it |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

### Exact Customer Terminology

Use explicit notes like: "We are using this phrase because customers said
`<phrase>` in `<reviews/Reddit/TikTok/source>`."

| Phrase | Source/context | What it means | How to use it | Avoid polishing into |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Gate 2: Avatar Selection

Selected avatar: **{avatar_label}**

Choose one avatar before concepting. If multiple avatars are attractive, make
separate concept batches.

| Avatar | Core desire | Core pain | Core objection | Language style | Source support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Decision:

- Selected avatar:
- Why this avatar first:
- Angles to avoid for this avatar:

## Gate 3: Mass Desire Selection

Selected mass desire / core focus: **{mass_desire_label}**

Ask the operator to choose one before building the angle bank.

Candidate mass desires:

| Mass desire | Source-backed proof | Best awareness level | Why it is worth testing |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

Decision:

- Selected mass desire:
- Related objection/misconception:
- Related behavior/moment:

## Gate 4: Competitor And Adjacent Ad Pull Plan

Do not invent the 70% lane from memory. Pull or reuse ads from Foreplay, Apify,
Meta/TikTok ad libraries, Pinterest mechanics, or approved ad-library cards.
Quote cost and get approval before paid pulls.

### Direct Competitors / Category Sources

Target: 10 usable ideas.

| Brand/source | Where to pull | Why this source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  | not pulled |

### Adjacent Niches

Target: 10 usable ideas.

| Adjacent niche | Example brands/sources | Why it maps to this avatar/desire | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  | not pulled |

## Gate 5: Ad Analysis And Opportunity Extraction

Use this table for every pulled competitor or adjacent ad. Do not only
summarize the ad. Extract the opportunity.

| ID | Source lane | Reference | Mechanic | What works | What they did wrong | Missed opportunity | How we can emulate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | direct_competitor |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | adjacent_niche |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Gate 6: 70 / 20 / 10 Concept Source Mix

Use this mix before selecting formats.

| Lane | Target | Actual | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 70% proven outside references |  |  | direct competitors + adjacent niches |
| 20% internal winners |  |  | prior client/agency winners if available |
| 10% new swings |  |  | fresh hypotheses only after proven lanes |

### 10 Competitor Ideas

| Idea | Source ad | Mechanic | Awareness level | Evidence level | Adaptation note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

### 10 Adjacent Niche Ideas

| Idea | Source ad | Mechanic | Awareness level | Evidence level | Adaptation note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Internal Winners

| Winner | What worked | How to remix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

### New Swings

| Idea | Hypothesis | Risk | Why it may be worth testing |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Gate 7: Angle Bank By Awareness Level

Build this after choosing the mass desire. Use exact source language where
possible.

| Awareness level | Angle | Hook territory | Source phrase | Why it works | Proof needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unaware |  |  |  |  |  |
| problem-aware |  |  |  |  |  |
| solution-aware |  |  |  |  |  |
| product-aware |  |  |  |  |  |
| most-aware |  |  |  |  |  |

### Verbatim-First Quote Bank

When source quotes exist, start copy from the customer's actual words. The
goal is to say it back in ad form, not to polish it into generic marketing
language.

| Raw quote / exact phrase | Source type | Theme/gap | Ad-ready line | What changed and why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | review / Amazon / TikTok / Reddit / competitor review / own review |  |  |  |

Rules:

- Prefer verbatim or near-verbatim customer wording for hooks, first lines,
  bullets, objections, and UGC/story copy.
- Add a source note for every important line so the operator knows why those
  words are being used.
- Only rewrite for clarity, length, compliance, or fit to the selected visual
  format.
- Do not flatten vivid customer language into generic claims.

## Gate 8: Visual Format / Template Selection

Stop here and ask the operator which format/template to use.

Examples:

- us vs them
- receipt comparison
- apology note
- calendar screenshot
- testimonial/story overlay
- comparison grid
- TikTok pill stack
- IG Story square box
- organic caption
- founder note

Selected format/template:

- Format:
- Why this format fits the angle:
- What the template controls:
- What research controls:

### Optional Branch: Foreplay Library Emulation And Ad Cards

Use this branch when the operator provides a large Foreplay library and wants to
emulate candidates before deciding which angle/copy belongs on each visual.

Default sequence:

```text
Foreplay Library -> Simple HF Emulation -> Canva Magic Text -> Ad Card ->
Angle Fit -> Copy Set -> Approval -> Finalize
```

Rules:

- Run the first pass as simple natural-language emulation: reference ad +
  product image, small surface changes, no heavy final-copy decisions yet.
- Upload the first-pass output to Canva and use Magic Text so only visible ad
  text becomes editable.
- Create an ad card before assigning final copy.
- Match the angle to the ad card's mechanic and text capacity.
- If the selected angle does not fit the available text zones, choose a
  different angle or a different emulated ad.

#### Post-Emulation Ad Card Template

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Candidate ID |  |
| Source Foreplay ad |  |
| First-pass output / Canva link |  |
| Scene / visual context |  |
| Ad mechanic | us vs them / receipt / founder note / testimonial / routine screenshot / product comparison / proof static / UGC native / other |
| Persuasion mechanism |  |
| Product role | hero / handheld / staged / background / comparison object / other |
| Existing text zones |  |
| Approximate text capacity | e.g. one headline + one caption, 4 short bullets, long note body |
| Awareness level fit |  |
| Best angles this format can carry |  |
| Bad angles for this format |  |
| Exact VOC phrases that can fit |  |
| Canva edit notes |  |
| Center 1:1 crop-safe notes |  |
| Static Mistake Filter risks |  |
| Recommended angle/copy direction |  |

## Gate 9: Template-Specific Copy Set

Complete this only after the operator chooses the visual format/template.

### Benefits To List

| Awareness level | Benefit | Benefit-depth level | Raw quote / exact phrase | Ad-ready wording |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| unaware |  |  |  |  |
| problem-aware |  |  |  |  |
| solution-aware |  |  |  |  |
| product-aware |  |  |  |  |
| most-aware |  |  |  |  |

### Negatives / Comparison Bullets To List

| Awareness level | Negative/comparison bullet | What it contrasts against | Raw quote / exact phrase | Ad-ready wording |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| unaware |  |  |  |  |
| problem-aware |  |  |  |  |
| solution-aware |  |  |  |  |
| product-aware |  |  |  |  |
| most-aware |  |  |  |  |

### Five Headline Options

Keep headlines clear. Prefer 6-10 words when possible. Rank by
scroll-stopping power and relevance.

| Rank | Headline | Awareness level | Why it works | Raw quote / exact phrase | Source |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |

## Gate 10: Static Mistake Filter

Before production, confirm:

- Main hook is readable in one second.
- Main hook survives center 1:1 crop.
- The concept moves the sale forward.
- The copy is not generic.
- The hook uses benefit depth beyond level one when research supports it.
- The line is grounded in research, not cleverness.
- The visual authenticity matches the claim.

Failure notes:

- 

## Approval Gate

Do not make the ads until the operator approves:

- selected avatar
- selected mass desire
- source mix / references
- angle bank
- selected visual format/template
- template-specific benefits, negatives, and headlines
- Static Mistake Filter pass

Approval status:

- [ ] Approved for production
- [ ] Needs revision
