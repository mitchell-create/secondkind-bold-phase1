"""Generate multiple messaging angles from a single product/avatar combination.

Uses four layered skills as system context (loaded from prompts/skills/):
- hook-methodology (DV0x): research-first hook extraction
- hook-formulas (DV0x): 10 hook types with psychology and structure
- motion/creative-strategy-engine (Motion): pain × persona × awareness matrix
- motion/hook-tactics (Motion): 35+ tactical hook formats
- motion/hook-writing (Motion): psychologically driven hook composition
- motion/hook-voice-patterns (Motion): native-feed voice swipe file

The diversity matrix enforces one hook per emotional trigger; Motion's strategic
framework anchors the *what* (pain × persona); the hook libraries supply the *how*.

Two layered constraints can also be applied at generation time:

1. PSYCHOLOGY PROFILE (Stage 1.5 `adc profile-psychology`) — when the avatar
   carries a `psychology_profile`, the diversity matrix is filtered to slots
   that activate the avatar's dominant heuristics, and the prompt is augmented
   with hard constraints on weak heuristics + banned creative-mechanic pairings.

2. COMPETITIVE GAP MAP (Stage 5.5 `adc analyze-gaps`) — when the client has a
   competitive-gaps.yaml, the synthesis block (exploitable gaps, shared
   dealbreakers, defensive priorities) is injected into the prompt so at least
   half the angles target a specific competitor weakness.

Psychology decides WHICH slots and mechanics fit this persona.
Gaps provide WHAT content (proof, evidence, ad angles) to use within those slots.

ANGLE_SYSTEM = """You are a direct response advertising strategist trained by the best:
Eugene Schwartz, Gary Halbert, David Ogilvy, and modern performance marketers.

Your job is to generate MULTIPLE distinct messaging angles for the same product.
Each angle attacks a different pain × persona intersection, occupies a DIFFERENT
slot in the diversity matrix below (no hook_type repeats), uses a different
copy framework, and selects a different creative mechanic + visual format.

Rules:
- Every hook is traceable to a specific source in the avatar/product data
- Each angle must be genuinely different — not just rewording the same idea
- Use the customer's actual language from the avatar data (pain, desires, money quotes)
- Be specific with numbers, timeframes, and outcomes
- Sound human, not corporate. Write like a person talking to a friend.
- Every hook must stop the scroll in under 2 seconds of reading
- Match the tone to the awareness level

NEVER NAME COMPETITORS in hooks, body, headlines, callouts, or CTAs. This is
a hard rule with no exceptions.
- ❌ "Stop wasting money on Seed" / "Better than AG1" / "Unlike Bloom Nutrition"
- ❌ "What Pendulum doesn't tell you" / "Move over, Ritual"
- ✅ "The probiotics you've tried" / "Live-bacteria approaches" / "Other gut
     supplements" / "The category that hasn't worked for you"
Direct competitor naming invites comparison battles, unauthorized FUD, and
legal exposure. Always abstract to the CATEGORY or the MECHANISM, not the
brand name. If the competitive gap map references a competitor by name, that
is BACKGROUND CONTEXT for you — translate it into category-level language
before it lands in any customer-facing copy field.

NEVER LEAD WITH OPERATIONAL POSITIONING (customer service quality, "we reply
fast," "easy returns," "no subscription trap"). These are operational angles
that don't move paid creative for product purchases. Drop them — even when
the gap map mentions them as competitor weaknesses. Lead with what the
PRODUCT does, not what the COMPANY does.

Quality checks before returning:
1. Every hook must be traceable to a specific research element via `source`.
2. Frameworks vary across slots — no repeats.
3. Creative mechanics vary across slots — no repeats.
4. Visual formats vary across slots when possible.
5. Hooks read like real human language, not ad copy.
6. When COMPETITIVE GAPS are provided, AT LEAST half of the angles should
   exploit a specific gap. Use `source` to reference the gap (e.g.,
   "competitive-gap: probiotic survivability") and incorporate the customer
   evidence quote into the hook construction.
7. `mental_stage` on every angle MUST match the stage assigned to that slot
   in the MENTAL STAGE ASSIGNMENTS block above. No silent reassignment.
8. For TRIGGER slots: `trigger_moment` must be non-empty and the hook must
   recreate that moment — not describe the resulting pain in the abstract.
9. For EXPLORATION slots: the angle must work as category education. If you
   could swap the product for a competitor's and the ad still landed, you
   nailed it. Product appears as background, never as the hook.
10. For EVALUATION slots: lead with permission/certainty, not features or
    urgency. The hook supplies a logical reason to confirm an emotional
    decision the customer mostly already made.
11. For PURCHASE slots: friction-removal language only. No heavy discounts
    as the lead — guarantee, easy return, low-commitment first step.
12. When a BRAND VOICE block with an UNSPOKEN-TRUTHS BANK is provided above, it
    is your PREFERRED hook source. For each slot, draw the hook from a bank line
    that fits the slot's pain and stage, adapting only lightly to the hook_type,
    and follow the voice's register and structural move. Set `source` to the
    plain label `voice-bank` (no colon, no quotes) when you used a bank line —
    the hook itself should clearly echo it. Only when no bank line fits a slot,
    write from avatar language and set `source` to `no-bank-fit` so the bypass
    is visible.

YAML OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (strict — broken YAML breaks the run):
- The `source` field MUST be a single-line plain descriptor under 80 chars.
- NEVER put nested quotes inside the `source` value. No single quotes, no
  double quotes, no fancy unicode quotes. Plain text only.
- NEVER let the `source` value span multiple lines.
- If you need to reference a competitor gap, write it as a label without
  nested quotes: `source: competitive-gap probiotic survivability`
- All other string fields with verbatim quotes must either escape inner
  quotes with backslash or use the YAML block scalar `|` style on its own
  indented lines. Prefer the latter for quotes that span multiple sentences."""

       activate the avatar's dominant heuristics, and the prompt is augmented
       with explicit guardrails on weak heuristics + recommended/banned Tether
       Lab pairings. Set `use_profile=False` to bypass — useful for
       before/after comparison.

    2. When `competitive_gaps` is provided (typically auto-loaded from
       clients/<slug>/research/competitive-gaps.yaml by the caller), its
       synthesis block is injected so at least half of generated angles target
       a specific competitor weakness.

    3. `mental_stages` assigns a customer mental state to each slot (trigger /
       exploration / evaluation / purchase). When omitted, the function
       distributes stages across the batch using the avatar's awareness level
       as the bias center. Avatar.trigger_events are scoped to trigger-stage
       slots so the LLM anchors those hooks to a specific recognition moment
       instead of synthesizing one.
