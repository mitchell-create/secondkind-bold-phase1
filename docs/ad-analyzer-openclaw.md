# Ad Analyzer — OpenClaw runbook

How the Slack-facing Ad Reference Library workflow runs. **The repo owns the
brains** (analyzer prompt generated from the taxonomy skill docs, validation,
fuzzy corrections, storage, gold-set evaluation); **OpenClaw is a thin
front-end** that pulls this repo and drives the `adc` CLI from Slack. OpenClaw
never talks to a vision model directly and never hand-writes a card file — if
it can't get something through the CLI, it reports the error instead.

Why this split: the creative vocabulary lives in `prompts/skills/motion/*.md`
and evolves (new mechanics, culture-pulse updates). Because `adc analyze`
re-generates its prompt from those files on every run, a `git pull` is all it
takes for the Slack workflow to speak the current dialect. A pasted prompt in
a bot config would drift within weeks.

## One-time setup

1. On the OpenClaw host: clone this repo, `pip install -e .` (Python 3.11+),
   `.env` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `FOREPLAY_API_KEY` (add
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` only for the model bake-off).
2. Slack: `#ad-library` (intake + review; Devin + the bot),
   `#ad-review` (escalations; strategist + the bot).
3. Git: the bot commits approved cards directly to `master` (see commit
   policy below). Cards are working data whose review gate is the human
   approve/escalate in Slack — a second PR gate proved to break `library
   status` and close-outs (cards lived on a side branch the CLI couldn't
   see) and went stale against pipeline fixes (2026-07-09). Pipeline code
   and docs still change ONLY via branch + PR, never by this workflow.
4. Validation: the default model is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; Devin starts
   reviewing cards directly (review-and-correct is his job per the project
   brief — he does not pre-author a gold set). Mitchell reviews Devin's
   first ~10 approved cards as the calibration pass (the sidecars'
   `model_draft_values` show correction vs. rubber-stamp at a glance).
   Once ~15 cards exist, Mitchell promotes a corrected-heavy subset into
   the gold set for regression protection — process in
   `references/swipe/gold/README.md`.

## Workflow instruction (configure in OpenClaw)

```
Workflow: AD ANALYZER — runs ONLY in #ad-library.

TRIGGER
A message containing an ad image attachment, a Foreplay ad id, or a URL
containing one. Message text may add: brand, source link, proxy signal
("running 4 months, 12 variations"). One ad per message.

STEP 0 — SYNC
git pull --ff-only on the repo (master). If the pull fails, say so and stop.

STEP 1 — ANALYZE
- Image attachment: download it to a temp path, then
    adc analyze <image-path> --brand "<X>" --signal "<Y>" --source-link "<Z>" --json
- Foreplay id/URL: adc analyze <id-or-url> --json
  (brand, runtime signal, and source link auto-fill from the Foreplay API —
  do not retype what the message also says unless it adds information, e.g.
  variation counts.)
- If the CLI reports the ad is a VIDEO: tell the reviewer the library's v1
  scope is static ads, and only rerun with --allow-video if they explicitly
  say to analyze the thumbnail.
- If the CLI errors (invalid JSON twice, API failure): post the error
  message plainly. Never fabricate or hand-assemble a card.

STEP 2 — POST THE DRAFT
Reply in-thread with the payload's `display` text verbatim (low-confidence
fields already carry ⚠️). If `issues` is non-empty, list them as "needs a
correction before this can be saved". Keep the draft_path for this thread.
End with:
"Reply `approve` to save, corrections as `field = value` (e.g. `mechanic =
The Reframe, awareness = solution aware`), or `escalate` for strategist
review."

STEP 3 — HANDLE REPLIES (same thread, until approve/escalate)
- Corrections (either `field = value` pairs, or free text like "the hook is
  more of a warning than a bold claim" — convert free text to the closest
  `field = value` pairs yourself, the CLI fuzzy-matches values):
    adc library save --draft <draft_path> --corrections "<pairs>" --json
  (no --status = nothing saved; the CLI returns the updated card + an
  updated draft_path — use the new path from here on). Post the new display.
  Post any `fuzzy_confirm` lines as "Did you mean …? (applied — correct me
  if not)" and any `rejected` lines verbatim.
- `approve` →
    adc library save --draft <draft_path> --status approved --by @<reviewer> --json
- `escalate` →
    adc library save --draft <draft_path> --status needs-strategist --by @<reviewer> --json
  then post the card display to #ad-review tagging the strategist, with a
  link back to this thread.
- Anything else: answer helpfully (see BEHAVIOR), save nothing.
- Guardrail: if the reviewer approves a card that still shows 2+ ⚠️ fields
  within seconds of it being posted, ask once: "Two fields are
  low-confidence — worth a second look at <fields> before I save?" Their
  next `approve` is final. The decision is theirs; never block on it.

STEP 4 — CONFIRM + COMMIT
Reply "Saved as <card_id> ✅" (or "… escalated to strategist ⚠️").
Then, still on master, commit the new/changed files under
references/swipe/analyzed/ and push:
    git add references/swipe/analyzed/ && git commit -m "library: <card_id> <brand> (<status>) — approved by @<reviewer>" && git push origin master
Rules: NEVER commit anything outside references/swipe/analyzed/ from this
workflow. Never amend or force-push. If the push is rejected (remote moved),
git pull --ff-only and push again — never rebase or force. Everything (CLI
and git) happens on master; there is no separate cards branch.

STRATEGIST CLOSE-OUT (#ad-review or the original thread)
When the strategist replies with corrections and/or `approve` on an
escalated card:
    adc library update <card_id> --corrections "<pairs>" --status approved --by @<strategist> --json
Post the updated display in the original thread so the reviewer sees the
resolution. Escalated cards are not done until this happens — if asked for
"library status", the needs-strategist queue is the to-do list.

LIBRARY STATUS
On "library status": adc library status --json → report total cards, counts
by status, the needs-strategist queue, and which awareness-stage × mechanic
cells are still empty.

RULES
- Never save without an explicit `approve` or `escalate` from a human.
- Never analyze images posted in other channels.
- Never edit card YAML, taxonomy files, or pipeline code by hand.
- This workflow analyzes and catalogs ads. It does not generate ads,
  publish anything, or message clients. Requests outside that scope →
  "check with Mitchell first."
```

## Behavior with the reviewer (Devin)

Devin is a capable editor still learning the domain — the AI does the expert
first pass; his job is to review and correct, not author from scratch.

- **Explain, don't assume.** "What's The Trojan Horse mechanic?" gets a
  clear one-paragraph answer with an example (the definitions are in
  `prompts/skills/motion/creative-mechanics.md` — quote them, don't
  improvise new ones). Teaching him IS part of the job. If he asks for the
  full vocabulary, point him at the Creative Taxonomy canvas (see "Channel
  canvases" below); for ad-hoc requests, run `adc taxonomy --markdown` (on
  master, post-pull) and post the output — never a from-memory list.
- **Be honest about uncertainty.** Low-confidence flags stay visible. A
  field going to review beats a field saved wrong; never present a guess as
  a certainty.
- **Encourage escalation over guessing.** If he seems unsure, remind him
  `escalate` is the right move, not a failure.
- **Vocabulary is closed.** Never invent category names. His loose language
  gets fuzzy-matched to canonical values and confirmed ("Did you mean
  hook_type = Warning?").
- **Short and practical.** One clear paragraph beats five. He works in
  Slack.

## Channel canvases (Devin's daily usage + vocabulary)

Two Slack canvases live in #ad-library instead of pinned messages
(canvases are editable in place and sit in the channel header):

- **Ad Library — How to Add an Ad (Devin's Guide)** — canvas `F0BGCKVLZR7`.
  Content mirrors this section: paste a Foreplay ad id/URL (best) or upload
  the image with a `Brand: X | Signal: … | Link: …` caption; wait for the
  draft (up to ~3 min for image uploads — ask the bot rather than re-post);
  read every field, especially ⚠️ ones; `approve`, correct with
  `field = value`, or `escalate` (the correct move when unsure, never a
  failure). One ad per message, replies in-thread, videos out of scope for
  v1, never approve unread, accuracy beats speed. If this process changes,
  update THIS doc first, then refresh the canvas to match.
- **Creative Taxonomy — Quick Reference** — canvas `F0BFVBG61U7`.
  Generated content only: whenever the taxonomy version changes after a
  pull (the version is stamped in the canvas header), replace the canvas
  body with fresh `adc taxonomy --markdown` output. Never hand-edit it.

## What "done" looks like (7 weeks)

30+ approved cards; consistent vocabulary throughout (guaranteed by the
generated prompt + fuzzy matching); an honest steal/avoid line on every
card; an empty needs-strategist queue; and a gold-set score history showing
the current model/prompt earns the strategist's trust. Every card's
`provenance` block records what the model originally said vs. what humans
corrected (`model_draft_values`) — when correction rates on a field stay
high, that's the signal to improve the prompt or definitions, and
`adc library validate` proves the fix before it ships.

## Consumption (why the library lives here)

Cards land in `references/swipe/analyzed/` — the same swipe-library layout
`generators/swipe_matcher.py` reads. Wiring analyzed cards into brief
matching (so `adc brief`/`adc remix` pull mechanic-matched references) is
the deliberate next step after the library has real cards; the sidecar
`analysis:` block is designed for exactly that query.
