"""Tests for strategy/angle_multiplier.py — diversity matrix filtering and prompt assembly.

LLM call itself is not exercised (mocking a generative call tests Anthropic,
not us). Focus is on the deterministic logic: which slots survive a given
profile, what the psychology block looks like, and how the prompt template
interpolates with and without a profile.
